# Introduction #
The FantaBobMod is a Minecraft mod based on the Minecraftian celebrities TheFantasio974 and Boblennon.  
It adds multiple items, blocks, achievements and mods to the game.  
The last official version published is for Minecraft 1.3.2, and it will hopefully be updated and rewritten when the official modding API is released.
The mod was updated to 1.5.2 by robin4002 and ported to FML & Forge
